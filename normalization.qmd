The goal is to avoid update anomalies, insert anomalies, and delete anomalies.

## Update Anomalies
Customer address change requires updates to every occurrence of the customer address.

## Insert Anomalies
New customers will not be added until they place an order, or they will be added with null values.

## Delete Anomalies
Deleting an order for a customer with only one purchase will result in the deletion of all customer information.
